						<h4 class="first">Privacy Policy</h4>
						<p>We don’t care to know you. Really. We don’t care who you’re friends with, where you work, your politics, what media you consume, or what you like to buy. Kohort’s product is the platform, not you. Use a throwaway email address to signup, a fake name for your profile, and lie about your location (or don’t enter it at all!). We don’t care. Our job is to make group communication efficient and effective. So if you want to join a fake group with a fake profile then, well, that’d be a little weird, but knock yourself out. At Kohort, our privacy policy can be summed up pretty easily: you own your data, period.</p>

						<h4>Content</h4>
						<p>You own everything you post and/or create. It will never be sold, shared, or even monitored. If we’re made aware of illegal content then we’ll have to deal with it as provided by law. But otherwise, we’re uninterested. We’re not scanning your photos with facial recognition, piping your text into AI, or building a social network graph of everyone you interact with. We’re not doing anything with your content other than hosting it.</p>

						<h4>Data Collection and Tracking</h4>
						<p>We of course employ internal analytics to see what features are being used with what frequency, but that data is anonymous and aggregated and will never be used to learn something about you as an individual. We don’t track you. The only app feature that uses what may be considered personal information is our implementation of geolocation tools. If you’re searching for groups within a certain proximity then the results will be tailored to the IP address that the request came from.</p>
