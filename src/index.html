								<h4>A successful pilot...</h4>
								<p>“Kohort ran their first sports team pilot with our football team who had a miracle season. Over the course of the season, that community grew to well north of 400 members and continues to grow. That success opened the doors for other teams like volleyball, wrestling, tennis, cheer, boys and girls basketball and lacrosse. Even the marching band and a few academic teams are now on Kohort. We’ve gone so far as to create a Sports Internship Program with Kohort. This gives kids who have a passion for sports, technology, content, and journalism the opportunity to cover their favorite school teams. We’re Ridgewood Maroons at heart but we definitely have a soft spot for the Kohort purple.”</p>

								<h4>Academic teams</h4>
								<p>“We recently ran a pilot with Kohort around our largest National History Bee & Bowl state championship tournament of the academic year, and it was a massive success. Whether it was providing the latest score updates, playoff announcements, or the list of students who passed the qualifying exams, Kohort helped us get this important information to coaches, students, and parents in near real time. We also loved the ability to take and share photos and albums which added a nice human element to our event. We’re excited to expand our Kohort pilot program to include our upcoming slate of academic competitions, including our National and World Championships later this year.”</p>

								<h4>Two groups with different needs</h4>
								<p>“I use Kohort for my recipe club and my son’s football and lacrosse teams. With Kohort, our monthly recipe club meetings are made easy with RSVP and Calendar. We also use Task Lists to divvy up responsibilities - who’s on appetizers, entrée, wine, dessert, etc. And it’s a great place to share recipes. In sports, I love using Rosters to identify the players on the field and their parents in the stands. Shared Photo Albums are pretty amazing too. We have an army of parent photographers who now have an easy way to share their best game shots. It’s more effective than email and less annoying than a group text. It’s how people communicate today.”</p>

								<h4>Mass Communication</h4>
								<p>Kohort delivers every type of communication: push notifications, in-app alerts, & emails. If an event is cancelled due to poor weather, you can easily notify everyone with the push of a button. No more worrying about gathering contact details and managing unwieldy contact lists. And if you’re an advanced user, you can target mass communications across a matrix of sister groups and their respective subgroups.</p>

							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/subgroups.svg">
								<h4>Subgroups & Sister Groups</h4>
								<p>Subgroups allow communications to be parsed into smaller groups within the larger group to cut down the noise. And similar to the efficiency of subgroup communications, Sister Groups do so on a larger scale, connecting two groups together – allowing you to crosspost content albums and events between the two. If you oversee your local chapter, but looking to connect with a sister chapter, you can connect the two on cross-chapter initiatives like fund-raising and recruiting.</p>
