						<h3>Posting</h3>
						<p>Its easy to craft any post however you'd like such as attaching a shared photo album to an post, or adding a task list to your event</p>
					</div>			
					<div class="col-sm-8">
						<div class="row features">
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/form.svg">
								<h4>Forms</h4>
								<p>With Forms, gathering information from your group members has never been easier. With an easy-to-view results page, you now have the information at your fingertips.  From there, you can generate a PDF and print from your phone. This is especially helpful with registration, merchandise orders, and post-event surveys.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/author.svg">
								<h4>Post Author</h4>
								<p>Kohort gives group owners the option to post as the voice of the group or themselves. For example, posts such as upcoming schedule and photo albums fit nicely under the group voice whereas commenting on a post is more appropriate coming from the individual.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row features">
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/poll.svg">
								<h4>Polls</h4>
								<p>Want to get a steer from your membership on an open question? Kohort allows you to easily create polls which can help guide operations on key issues.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/task.svg">
								<h4>Task Lists</h4>
								<p>Kohort allows you to attach a task list to any post. You can even assign blocks of time to the tasks. And if you need to assign tasks to specific members, just left-swipe the task. Also easy to undo these assignments if things change. </p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row features">
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/rsvp.svg">
								<h4>RSVPs and Availability</h4>
								<p>RSVPs and Availability extend to both players and all group members. So you can now have an accurate player headcount for tomorrow's game, but also a headcount for the end-of-year BBQ that includes everyone (players, parents, coaches, etc.).</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/recurring.svg">
								<h4>Recurring Events</h4>
								<p>Great for scheduling practices. In a single event post, you can enter every practice for the entire season. You also have the ability to edit them all at once or one at a time. Kohort makes scheduling recurring events easier and more intuitive than even stand-alone calendars.</p>

						<h3>Organizing</h3>
						<p>For every minute spent organizing, an hour is earned. Kohort gives you all the tools to earn you days.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-8">
						<div class="row features">
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/communications.svg">
								<h4>Mass Communication</h4>
								<p>Notify members of important information with push notifications, in-app alerts, or emails. If an event is cancelled due to poor weather, you can easily notify everyone with the push of a button. Advanced users can target mass communications across a matrix of sister groups and their respective subgroups.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/universal.svg">
								<h4>À La Carte Group Features</h4>
								<p>While the universal feature set is plenty for most groups, Kohort also gives admins the ability to add new features to their group. Features range from Celebrations (upcoming birthdays, graduations, & anniversaries) to In-Memoriam (preserving the history and photos of past members).</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row features">
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/privacy.svg">
								<h4>Profiles and Privacy Settings</h4>
								<p>Create personal or professional profiles to suit each group. Customize which notifications and alerts you receive separately for each group that you’re a member of. You also control how much or how little personal contact information you want to make available on a group-by-group basis.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/users_chat.svg">
								<h4>Member Directory</h4>
								<p>A robust member directory starts with knowing who belongs to your group and how to contact them, especially when some members may not be in your address book. Kohort captures all the key member details which are easy to update in your profile settings.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row features">
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/admin.svg">
								<h4>Member Adminstration</h4>
								<p>Everyone needs help running a group. Kohort lets you easily promote members to admin status to help manage operations. And when it comes time for a change of guard, you can promote others to co-owner status and then step down when you’re ready.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/message.svg">
								<h4>Direct Messaging</h4>
								<p>Kohort provides a full-featured, robust, multi-person chat experience. You can chat 1:1, with multiple people, or group chat with all members. This is especially helpful when you’re trying to coordinate an activity with contacts not in your address book.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row features">
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/subgroups.svg">
								<h4>Subgroups</h4>
								<p>Subgroups allows admins to parse communications into smaller groups within the larger group. Communications can now be appropriately tailored to cut down the noise. Kohort knows there are plenty of times when you want to reach a subgroup of the wider program and now you can.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/crosspost.svg">
								<h4>Sister Groups</h4>
								<p>In much the same way subgroups make group communication more efficient, sister groups do so on a larger scale. If you oversee your group’s local chapter, but looking to connect with a sister chapter, you can now connect the groups. This is especially helpful with cross-chapter initiatives like fund-raising and recruiting.</p>

								<img class="icon" src="assets/images/icons/roster.svg">
								<h4>Team Roster</h4>
								<p>Rosters are built to be as self-service as a coach wants them to be. We’ve eliminated a lot of the data entry by allowing parents and players to create a roster spot, or attach themselves to an existing one, as they join the team. Coaches can  edit, delete, and merge any roster entry at any time.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6 box">
